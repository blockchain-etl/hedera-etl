/**
 * FullDeduplication does deduplication of all transactions before 'endTimestamp' of last successful incremental run.
 * <p/>
 * Need for full deduplication:
 * <p/>
 * It takes about an hour or more for a newly inserted transaction to make it from streaming buffer to regular
 * partitions (accessible by DML operations). Incremental deduplication logic assumes that transactions can arrive out
 * of order, however, they won't be delayed by as much as an hour. <br>
 * That is, if deduplication logic has checked data up to point X where X = (now - 90min), then there would be no new
 * transaction with consensusTimestamp < X. This is fair assumption since in a normally functioning system, delays
 * due to PubSub, or transient errors in Dataflow, or transient errors in BigQuery streaming inserts won't be more
 * than few minutes. <br>
 * Above assumption also incorporates in itself the fact that no duplicates should arrive as late as an hour.
 * <p/>
 * However, above assumption breaks down when the system is not functioning normally. To list some of the scenarios:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If importer (publishing to pubsub) crashes. It can publish duplicates when it comes back up much later</li>
 *   <li>If dataflow pipeline crashes due to a bug. It'll likely take more than an hour to fix it and restart
 *   the pipeline.</li>
 * </ul>
 * To cover such scenarios, running an infrequent job which does deduplication over all past data is necessary.
